			<p>It proved the perfect race for Red Bull’s Max Verstappen as he kicked off his world drivers’ championship title defence in style by winning the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix in dominant fashion. 

Starting from pole position, the Dutchman effectively led from start to finish as teammate Sergio Perez made it a one-two finish for last year’s constructors' championship victors. 

Just behind, Fernando Alonso rolled back the years to claim his 99th podium finish in F1 as he pushed out fellow Spaniard Carlos Sainz to finish in P3. 

The Bahrain Grand Prix proved another headache for Ferrari though, as Sainz’s teammate Charles Leclerc was forced to retire after his car suffered a huge failure whilst the Monegasque driver occupied P3. 

Lewis Hamilton, Lance Stroll, George Russell, Valtteri Bottas, Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon rounded out the points-paying position as Formula One returned. </p>

			<p>The 25-year-old Dutchman repeated as Formula 1 world champion in 2022 after winning his maiden title last season. He and the Red Bull Racing team swept the Driver’s and Constructor’s Championships with the help of Mexican veteran Sergio Perez, who finished third in the standings.

It marked the first time since 2013 that Red Bull and one of its drivers took both titles from the F1 grid. It was last done when Sebastian Vettel clinched his fourth consecutive championship with the team in his penultimate season with it before his move to Ferrari.

Verstappen won 15 of the 22 Grands Prix and finished 146 points ahead of runner-up Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc. After winning the Constructor’s Championship for eight straight seasons, Mercedes took an unexpected step back and finished third in the standings. George Russell, in his first season with the team, won his first race at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix but finished behind both Red Bull drivers as well as Leclerc in points. 

Lewis Hamilton finished sixth in the standings and failed to win a race during the season for the first time in his 16-year career. Statistically, it was the worst season he’s ever had, as he never secured a pole, finished outside the top five in points for the first time, and led a career-low 46 laps throughout the season.

Looking ahead to 2023, the grid will have a drastically different appearance. Vettel has announced his retirement from F1 and Fernando Alonso will take his place at Aston Martin. Pierre Gasly will take over Alonso’s seat at Alpine, and Daniel Ricciardo will reunite with Red Bull to be the team’s reserve driver. McLaren will replace Ricciardo with incoming rookie Oscar Piastri, who won the 2021 Formula 2 title.

Nico Hulkenberg will return to full-time competition as he pairs with Kevin Magnussen at Haas. Mick Schumacher and Nicholas Latifi will not be on the grid, and for the first time since Alexander Rossi’s brief stint in 2015, the United States will have representation in motorsports’ top series as Logan Sargeant joins the Williams team.</p>

		<h3>The unexpected one : Fernando Alonso</h3>
		<div class="images">
			<img src="images/alonso.jpeg" alt="">
			<p>Formula One's 2023 season began like a continuation of 2022, with Max Verstappen and Red Bull being in a league of one at the top and self-inflicted wounds for Ferrari. Yet there is one notable addition to the frontrunning pack this year thanks to Aston Martin building a mighty F1 car that means there's plenty to be excited about after the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix.

Verstappen may have eased into his first win of the year, but Fernando Alonso was the standout driver who took all the headlines. The two-time world champion was back to his best in his first race with the Silverstone-based Aston Martin team. Alonso took the fight to Mercedes and Ferrari and beat them comfortably to score his first Round 1 podium since 2013.

However, it could've been an entirely different story for Alonso after a Lap 1 collision with his new teammate Lance Stroll. Stoll, back from a wrist injury just 12 days earlier, braked too late when battling the Mercedes drivers and smacked into the back of the sister Aston Martin at Turn 4. Fortuitously no damage befell either green machine, but they fell behind Lewis Hamilton and George Russell for the opening laps. </p>
